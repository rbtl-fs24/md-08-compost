## Research Question

How does the contamination of organic waste with plastics affect the profitability of compost production in urban Blantyre, Malawi?

## Sampling Strategy {.smaller}

1.  **Labor Survey with Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC)**
    -   Identify the types and duration of each activity required.

    -   Make a detailed account of the time that each activity takes, and the human and material resources allocated.
    
2.  **Cost Model**
    -   Combine data from TDABC with capital (land, infrastructure and
building, utility connections, consulting/advisory fees, etc.)
and operating costs (labor, equipment, personal protective
equipment (PPE), etc.).

    -   Model the profitability dependent on different parameters.
